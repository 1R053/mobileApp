# CloutFeed - The first BitClout mobile app for iOS & Android

CloutFeed is an open-source mobile app built on the top of [the BitClout blockchain](https://docs.bitclout.com/). A decentralized social media platform where everyone has his own digital coin. These creator coins are tied to the reputation of an individual. You can build your own personal brand on the top of them while connecting and socializing with other creators in a new decentralized way!
